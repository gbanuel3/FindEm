## Overview
### Description
Locate Friends is a social media app that allows you to create groups with friends. Everyone in the group will show up on an interactive map so that you know where in the world your friends are at any given point!

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
   - **Category:** Social Media
   - **Mobile:** Mobile-first experience, we need to use IOS Location Services in order to create the interactive map. Additionally, push notifications to notify a user about the proximity of their friends.
   - **Story:** Allows users to keep up with their friends in a real-time manner. Additionally allows families to create groups so that parents can keep watch over their children's location in the case of an emergency. 
   - **Market:** Friend groups who are unable to see each other in person often due to people moving away for college. Families who want to be informed of each other's location. Clubs at school who want to keep track of where their members are location when interning/living over the summer.
   - **Habit:** Users can be active at any time. The app will allow a user to set settings that will send push notifications whenever you get close or far from someone geographically. Later versions of the app will hopefully support messaging between groups. 
   - **Scope:** Start off with groups and an interactive map. Then you can add adding individual users as a friend and seeing them on the map. Then we can add push notifications that inform you of the location of particular friends. Then we can add messaging between members.
